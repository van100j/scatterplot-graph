=====================

[FCC's Visualize Data with Scatterplot Graph project challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/visualize-data-with-a-scatterplot-graph):

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONxvaa/.

2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

3. User Story: I can see performance time visualized in a scatterplot graph.

4. User Story: I can mouse over a plot to see a tooltip with additional details.

5. Hint: Here's a dataset you can use to build this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/cyclist-data.json
